The course aims at providing hands-on experience with state of the art distributed data processing environments. First, it addresses cloud computing concepts and tools. Then, it provides a bottom-up overview of distributed storage and processing technologies, emphasizing scalability and usability. Finally, it introduces basic systems and information security concepts, as required to safely use current distributed environments.

## Learning outcomes

- Discuss key performance, scalability, and reliability trade-offs in distributed computing environments.
- Identify main cloud computing concepts and technologies.
- Employ cloud-based storage and computing resources for distributed data processing tasks.
- Contrast and select processing solutions for data science problems.
- Assess computer security and information security risks in cloud data storage and processing.
- Select and apply techniques to mitigate security risks.

## Instructors
